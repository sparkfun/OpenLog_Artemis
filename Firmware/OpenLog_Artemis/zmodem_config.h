// Dylan (monte_carlo_ecm, bitflipper, etc.) - For smaller boards (32K flash, 2K RAM) it may only
// be possible to have only one or some of the following 3 features enabled at a time:  1) File manager
// commands (DEL, MD, RD, etc.), 2) SZ (Send ZModem) or 3) RZ (Receive ZModem).  Large boards
// like the Arduino Mega can handle all 3 features in a single sketch easily, but for smaller boards like
// Uno or Nano, it's very tight.  It seems to work okay, but if you don't need the file manager commands,
// or one of send or receive, comment out the associated macro and it'll slim the sketch down some.
